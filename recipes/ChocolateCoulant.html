  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>100 gr. sugar</li>
    <li>40 gr. Of flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of cocoa powder</li>
    <li>200 gr. chocolate for desserts</li>
    <li>80 gr. of butter</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>To prepare the chocolate coulant, we will start by putting the oven to heat to 180ºC, heat up and down.</li>
    <li>In a bowl we put the butter and chocolate, in another the eggs and sugar.</li>
    <li>Put the chocolate and butter in the microwave or we can melt it in a bain-marie, on the other hand we beat the sugar and eggs with the rods.</li>
    <li>Add the sifted flour and mix little by little.</li>
    <li>In this mixture we will put the chocolate that we have melted together with the butter and cocoa powder.</li>
    <li>Mix with a spatula with enveloping movements, little by little until all the chocolate is well mixed.</li>
    <li>Prepare some molds and spread them with a little butter.</li>
    <li>Fill the molds filling them ¾ parts of their capacity, as they rise.</li>
    <li>Put the molds in the oven for 7 minutes, look at the upper part of the coulant, when you see them without the chocolate shine they are ready.</li>
    <li>Remove them from the oven, we remove them from the molds very carefully and serve hot.</li>
