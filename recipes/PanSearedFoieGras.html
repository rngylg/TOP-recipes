  <h2>An elegant appetizer made with brioche, foie gras, a grapefruit-Chardonnay sauce</h2>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>0.5 pound foie gras</li>
    <li>0.5 cup of wine</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>0.5 tablespoon of unsalted butter</li>
    <li>0.25 tps of rosemary</li>
    <li>0.5 tps of zest orange</li>
    <li>1 tps of fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 tps of salt</li>
    <li>0.5 tps of blackpepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Start preparing foie gras by splitting the two lobes and remove excess fat if there is any</li>
    <li>Carefully eliminate the veins that are visible and discard</li>
    <li>Rinse foie gras with slightly cold water</li>
    <li>Dip a sharp knife in hot water and cut foie gras in 1 inch thick slices</li>
    <li>Wrap with a cling film and put it in the refrigerator</li>
    <li>Foie gras is ready to be seasoned and cooked later</li>
    <li>Take out prepared foie gras from the refrigerator and season each slice generously with salt and freshly grounded black pepper</li>
    <li>Take a medium sized saucepan and preheat it for about 2 minutes on low flame</li>
    <li>Put slices of foie gras in the pan and sear them for about 1 minute. Be cautious; do not overcook your foie gras</li>
    <li>Turn around the slices and sear for another minute. To get a perfectly seared foie gras it should be nicely done from the outside but rare from inside</li>
    <li>Remove the slices from the pan once they are done and put aside</li>
    <li>To make wine sauce, remove any excess fat or pan drippings and put the pan back on low to medium flame</li>
    <li>Add butter, garlic, orange zest and rosemary leaves and saut√© for a few seconds</li>
    <li>Add wine and let it simmer for two minutes</li>
    <li>To enhance the flavor squeeze fresh lemon juice in it and whisk well</li>
    <li>Your wine sauce is ready</li>
    <li>To assemble, gently place foie gras slices on the serving plates and drizzle wine sauce over it</li>
    <li>Garnish with orange zest and rosemary leaves and serve straightaway</li>
  </ol>
